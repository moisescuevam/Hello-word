# Hello-word
My name is Moises, but everyone calls me Mose. I was born in Ecuador but I grow up in Verona, Italy(Italy is GMT/UTC + 2h during Daylight Saving Time). I served a mission in England Manchester mission and I finish it 3 years ago. I have 3 siblings, two sisters and one brother. I studied Electronic, Program system and Mechanic in my high school. Right now, I work in an American bakery shop here in Italy. Where I can eat what I want, but I really love so much eat pasta with peperoni and bacon. 

      Other things that I love so much is travelling and serving, because give me the opportunity to learn new culture and have new friends. And through these thing that I love I met the missionaries and they change my life and the life of my family.  I'm super grateful to know the gospel because through the gospel my life changes a lot and I am so happy with it. I know with all my heart that He Life, He trust in everyone and He love so much us.
